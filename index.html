                                    Ukraine regained its independence in 1991 with the 
                                    dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since its independence, 
                                    Ukraine has been governed as a unitary republic under a 
                                    semi-presidential system. It declared itself a neutral 
                                    state,[16] forming a limited military partnership with 
                                    Russia and other CIS countries while also establishing 
                                    a partnership with NATO in 1994.
